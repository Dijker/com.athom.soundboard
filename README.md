# Soundboard

Upload your own sounds (mp3 and wav are supported) to Homey, and play them from the Flow Editor!

Example scenarios tested & proven to be useful:

* When Homey starts listening, make a Star Trek blip sound
* Turn Homey into a Cuckoo clock! Every hour, play a cuckoo sound
* When the contact sensor on the fridge is open, play Cookie Monster's Om Nom Nom Nom!
