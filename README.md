# Soundboard

Upload your own sounds (mp3 and wav are supported) to Homey, and play them from the Flow Editor!

To add sounds, install the App and navigate to Settings - Soundboard (under 'Apps', in the lower section of the right pane).

Mp3 and Wav files up to 900 KB are supported. Play sounds from the settings menu or by using the Soundboard Flow Action cards.

Example scenarios tested & proven to be useful:

* When Homey starts listening, make a Star Trek blip sound
* Turn Homey into a Cuckoo clock! Every hour, play a cuckoo sound
* When the contact sensor on the fridge is open, play Cookie Monster's Om Nom Nom Nom!
